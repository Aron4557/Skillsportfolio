            <h2>Welcome to My About Page</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer and Electronics Engineering at UNAM. My academic journey has provided me with a robust foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of technology. As a dedicated programmer and IT expert, I am skilled in various programming languages and technologies, and I thrive in both individual and team environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strengths include excellent time management, adaptability, and an open-minded approach to problem-solving. These qualities have enabled me to effectively tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to various projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my professional interests, I enjoy playing chess. This hobby helps me to enhance my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills, both of which are valuable in my technical work.
