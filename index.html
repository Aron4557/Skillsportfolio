        <h2>Author's words</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer and Electronics Engineering at UNAM, where I am developing a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of technology. With a keen interest in programming and web development, I have successfully completed and programmed several projects, honing my skills in creating efficient, user-friendly digital solutions.

            My academic journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of core engineering principles and hands-on experience with modern programming languages and technologies. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have worked extensively with backend technologies such as Node.js and Python. My projects reflect my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver innovative solutions, blending technical expertise with creative problem-solving.

            Driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning, I am eager to contribute to impactful projects and advance my skills in a dynamic professional environment. As a dedicated student and aspiring engineer, I am excited about the opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios and make meaningful contributions to the field.
